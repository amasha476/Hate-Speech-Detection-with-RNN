## About the Project

This project primarily describes the application of an RNN model to detect hate speech. 

### Techniques used
Python - Deep Learning Models - RNN

### Spes followed

Here, we import two python scripts to do this cleaning part and the feature extractions. They are,


1.   normalization.py - Use for data cleaning part
2.   feature_extractors.py - Use for feature extractions

Data cleaning steps:


*   Lowercasing


*   Remove URL's and emails


*   Tokenization

*   Removal of Punctuation

*   Stop Word Removal

*   Lemmatization
*   Removal of Special Characters or Numbers


*   Remove one letter token


*   Check the number of duplicate records

*   Check for the missing values
